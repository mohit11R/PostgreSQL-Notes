### What is data?

1) Facts collected together for reference or analysis.
2) Example -- facts related to you like your name, age, height, weight, etc. are some exmaple of data. Even images, files and PDFs are considered as data.

### Data vs Information

1) Data that has been convereted into a more useful or intelligible form. Data by itself is just a raw unit of information, but only after further processing or analysis does the data become more useful and meaningful, and that is when its called information.
2) Your score is your Math exam in first semester -- Data or information? it is data.
3) The complete class's marks would be a collection of these numbers. By itself its not very meaningful, its just a bunch of numbers. But when we do some aggregations, like suppose finding the average marks , we can understand how the class performed collectively. if the average was say 60/100, a possible insight is that the exam was difficult and that's why it was a low scoring one.

### What is a Database?

1) Set of related data organized in a way that it can be easily stored, changed and accessed at any time.
2) Let’s consider an example – Netflix. As per my understanding, Netflix has database for its movies and tv shows, and it should have another one for the login/credentials details of the users and the movies/tv shows that they have been watching. After doing some analysis and modeling, it also recommends movies based on your watched history.
