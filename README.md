### What is data?

1) Facts collected together for reference or analysis.
2) Example -- facts related to you like your name, age, height, weight, etc. are some exmaple of data. Even images, files and PDFs are considered as data.

### Data vs Information

1) Data that has been convereted into a more useful or intelligible form. Data by itself is just a raw unit of information, but only after further processing or analysis does the data become more useful and meaningful, and that is when its called information.
2) Your score is your Math exam in first semester -- Data or information? it is data.
3) The complete class's marks would be a collection of these numbers. By itself its not very meaningful, its just a bunch of numbers. But when we do some aggregations, like suppose finding the average marks , we can understand how the class performed collectively. if the average was say 60/100, a possible insight is that the exam was difficult and that's why it was a low scoring one.
